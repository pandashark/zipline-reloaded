Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix ``execute_daily_cancel_policy`` to cancel all orders for all assets at
  end of day, not just the first order for assets with multiple orders.
  Previously, assets with a single open order were skipped entirely. (:issue:`313`)
- Fix ``NoSlippage.process_order`` and ``FixedSlippage.process_order`` to use
  ``order.open_amount`` instead of ``order.amount``, preventing overfill of
  partially filled orders. (:issue:`313`)
- Fix ``VolumeShareSlippage.process_order`` to return ``(None, None)`` instead
  of bare ``None`` when price is NaN, preventing ``TypeError`` during tuple
  unpacking. (:issue:`313`)
- Fix ``before_trading_start`` to reset ``_in_before_trading_start`` flag via
  ``try/finally``, preventing orders from being permanently blocked after an
  exception in the user's callback. (:issue:`313`)
- Fix ``validate_order_params`` and ``__convert_order_params_for_blotter`` to
  use ``is not None`` checks for ``limit_price`` and ``stop_price`` instead of
  truthiness checks, allowing a price of ``0.0``. (:issue:`313`)
- Fix ``convert_cols`` in bcolz minute bar writer to use ``|=`` instead of
  ``&=`` for the exclude mask, so rows with uint32 overflow values are actually
  filtered out. (:issue:`314`)
- Fix infinite loop in ``DataPortal._get_daily_spot_value`` when searching
  backwards for a non-NaN close price by adding a bounds check against
  ``_first_trading_day``. (:issue:`314`)
- Fix infinite loop in ``BcolzDailyBarReader.get_last_traded_dt`` when
  ``NoDataAfterDate`` is raised and no previous session exists. (:issue:`314`)
- Fix ``DataPortal.get_adjustments`` to apply ``tz_localize`` to merger
  adjustment dates, consistent with splits and dividends. (:issue:`314`)
- Add path traversal validation to ``tar.extractall`` in the Quandl bundle
  loader (CVE-2007-4559). (:issue:`314`)
