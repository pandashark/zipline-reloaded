Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix ``convert_cols`` in bcolz minute bar writer to use ``|=`` instead of
  ``&=`` for the exclude mask, so rows with uint32 overflow values are actually
  filtered out. (:issue:`314`)
- Fix infinite loop in ``DataPortal._get_daily_spot_value`` when searching
  backwards for a non-NaN close price by adding a bounds check against
  ``_first_trading_day``. (:issue:`314`)
- Fix infinite loop in ``BcolzDailyBarReader.get_last_traded_dt`` when
  ``NoDataAfterDate`` is raised and no previous session exists. (:issue:`314`)
- Fix ``DataPortal.get_adjustments`` to apply ``tz_localize`` to merger
  adjustment dates, consistent with splits and dividends. (:issue:`314`)
- Add path traversal validation to ``tar.extractall`` in the Quandl bundle
  loader (CVE-2007-4559). (:issue:`314`)
